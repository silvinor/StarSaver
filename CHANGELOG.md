## [0.5.0] - 2024-10-23

### Added

- Defaults loaded from MacOS API 

### Changed

### Removed

- Removed use of the `config.json` file, including loading defaults.

## [0.4.0] - 2024-10-21

### Changed

- Created star offsets, so that the stars are drawn with a random offset, so as to not make it too "grid-like".  Stars are now placed in a more natural position (i.e. totally random, to the pixel).

## [0.3.0] - 2024-10-19

### Changed

- Efficiency: `drawRect` and star drawing areas are now only drawing changed rect's. not whole screen.
- Integrity: Sane defaults, and min/max checking on the config items

## [0.2.0] - 2024-10-18


### Changed

- Full rewrite to Vino Logic

### Removed

- All the ChatGPT code.  But it was instrumental in me understanding how screen savers work on MacOS

## [0.1.0] - 2024-10-17

### Added

- Initial upload - code 100% generated by ChatGPT after about 10 hours of guidance.
